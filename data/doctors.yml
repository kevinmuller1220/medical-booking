    and cosmetic surgery. With significant contributions to the field of plastic
    surgery, he has established himself as a talented and caring surgeon with a

    addition to being a co-owner and partner with the center, Dr. Kortesis mentors
    medical students and residents from UNC and Wake Forest, and teaches fellows

    of the Americas to aid pediatric burn victims.</p><p>Married and an active member
    of the Greek Church, Dr. Kortesis is a competitive marathoner, half-marathon
    tri-athlete and adventure sports enthusiast who believes in the power of overall

    MemoryShape® Breast Implants, in Sweden in 2014. This was under the study of
    a world famous surgeon, Dr. Charles Randquist of Stockholm, Sweden. Dr. Kortesis
    travels internationally for breast conferences and training seminars adding
    to his roster of clinical experience in this field.</p><p>He is a nominated

    Plastic Surgery Society in 2001.</p><p><b>Dedication to Patient Care</b></p><p>From
    the time Dr. Kortesis was young, he always wanted to go into medicine. He dreamed
    of being a doctor and helping others. However, it wasn’t until his last year
    of medical school that he decided on plastic surgery. The decision was based
    on being able to help a full range of patients—something other specialties did
    not offer.</p><p>Taking a special interest in breast reconstruction, body contouring,
    facial aesthetics with injections and fat grafting, and CO2 laser resurfacing,
    Dr. Kortesis has a genuine belief that helping others reach their greatest self-esteem
    is the ultimate reward.</p><p><b>Philanthropy &amp; Volunteer Work</b></p><p>Throughout
    his career, Dr. Kortesis has shown incredible compassion for his patients in
    and outside of the Hunstad Kortesis facility. Since treating patients in Bolivia,
    which afforded him the opportunity to aid pediatric patients with severe burn
    injuries, he was inspired to want to do more. He strongly believes in giving
    his time, energy and gift of reconstructive surgery to others and has committed
    to performing mission work each year.</p><p>On a personal level he is proud
    of his personal relationships and mentoring young children within his church
    community.</p><p><b>Certifications &amp; Licensure:</b></p><ul>\r\n<li>Member

    up his own clinic near Detroit,\r\n    Michigan. The business ultimately failed,
