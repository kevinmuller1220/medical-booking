bio_text = '<p>After qualifying as a specialist in 1960, Kevorkian bounced around the country
    from hospital to hospital, publishing more than 30 professional journal articles and
    booklets about his philosophy on death, before setting up his own clinic near Detroit,
    Michigan. The business ultimately failed, and Kevorkian headed to California to commute
    between two part-time pathology jobs in Long Beach. These jobs also ended quickly when
    Kevorkian quit in another dispute with a chief pathologist; Jack claimed that his career
    was doomed by physicians who feared his radical ideas.</p>
    <p>Kevorkian "retired" to devote his time to a film project about Handel\'s Messiah as
    well as research for his reinvigorated death-row campaign. By 1970, however, Kevorkian
    was still jobless and had also lost his fiancee; he broke off the relationship after
    finding his bride-to-be lacking in self-discipline. By 1982, Kevorkian was living alone,
    occasionally sleeping in his car, living off of canned food and social security.</p>'
